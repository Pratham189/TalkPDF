# TalkPDF
This project will build a PDF-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chat system called TalkPdf that extracts, processes, and queries data from PDFs. The system will leverage BeautifulSoup for web scraping, use LLMs for answering queries, and generate relevant responses based on extracted PDF data and web content.
